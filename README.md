ðŸš€ Project Highlight: Maintenance Management System (MMS)
ðŸ›  Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

I recently developed a full-stack Maintenance Management System as part of my academic project. This platform streamlines essential maintenance operations including:

âœ… Work Order Management
âœ… Preventive Maintenance Scheduling
âœ… Asset Tracking
âœ… Inventory Oversight
âœ… Report Generation for Admins

Key Achievements:
ðŸ”¹ Designed a responsive and intuitive UI using React
ðŸ”¹ Built secure and scalable REST APIs with Node.js and Express
ðŸ”¹ Implemented data persistence and querying with MongoDB
ðŸ”¹ Enhanced operational efficiency through automation and real-time updates

This project strengthened my skills in full-stack development and taught me how to build systems that solve real-world problems in facilities and operations management.

ðŸ”— Excited to apply these skills in future development challenges!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
